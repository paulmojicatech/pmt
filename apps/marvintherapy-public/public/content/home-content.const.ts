export const INDIVIDUAL_TYPE_DESCRIPTION = `As a clinical psychotherapist, I work from different theoretical perspectives to meet
clients’ diverse needs.  I take into account the preferences and the issues that clients
want to resolve in deciding which is the best approach or combination of approaches for
treatment. That being said, my primary treatment modality is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
(CBT).  My goal is to help you uncover your true potential and lead a life that is worth
celebrating.  While we can't change difficult situations of the past, we can work
together to better understand and resolve challenges in your life.  By applying
complementary therapy approaches and techniques, we will unearth long-standing
behavior patterns or negative perceptions that may be holding you back from
experiencing a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

Kirstin R. Abraham, LCSW provides individual, couples, family, and maritial counseling

Behavioral telehealth also benefits patients who can access care from their homes with more options for safety, privacy, and convenience.

Behavioral telehealth may also be referred to as telebehavioral health, telemental health, or telepsychology.
